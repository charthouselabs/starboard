1. View funding rate information before opening position
2. Monitor ongoing funding costs for open positions
3. Understand how funding rates are calculated
4. View funding payment history
5. Factor funding costs into position sizing through Client SDK calculator

**Prerequisite Stories**: STAR-107, STAR-108, STAR-109

**Prerequisite Technical Stories**: 
- Funding rate mechanism

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- **Functional Requirements**:
  - Funding rate display on position entry form (rate per 8 hours)
  - Cost calculator in Client (bonsai layer): position_size * funding_rate * (hours_held / 8)
  - Funding direction indicator (pay/receive based on long/short and rate)
  - Break-even calculator including funding costs
  - Accumulated funding display per position
  - Funding payment history with timestamps and amounts
  - Projected funding costs for 1 day, 7 days, 30 days
  
- **Non-Functional Requirements**:
  - Funding calculations update in real-time
  - Historical funding data for 90 days
  - Calculator accuracy to 6 decimal places
  - Mobile-friendly calculator interface
  - Documentation of funding mechanism

**Unhappy Paths**:
  - Extreme funding rates trigger warning
  - Calculator overflow handled gracefully
  - Missing historical data shows available range
  - Negative rates clearly explained

### STAR-120: Select Network (Testnet/Mainnet)

**Name**: Select Network (Testnet/Mainnet)

**Story**: As a trader, I want to select between testnet and mainnet so that I can test the platform before using it with real funds or switch to the production environment.

**User Flow Diagram**:
```mermaid

    participant User
    participant Frontend
    participant NetworkManager
    participant Wallet
    participant Contracts
    
    User->>Frontend: Click network selector in header
    Frontend-->>User: Show network options
    User->>Frontend: Select network
    Frontend->>NetworkManager: Switch network
    NetworkManager->>Wallet: Request network switch
    Wallet-->>User: Approve switch
    User->>Wallet: Confirm
    Wallet-->>NetworkManager: Network switched
    NetworkManager->>Contracts: Update endpoints
    NetworkManager-->>Frontend: Network updated
    Frontend-->>User: Show new network in header
```

**Task Flow**:
1. Visit Starboard Finance platform
2. See network selector in header
3. Choose between Testnet and Mainnet
4. Confirm network switching
5. See updated network indicator in header
6. Wallet automatically switches to correct network

**Prerequisite Stories**: STAR-112

**Prerequisite Technical Stories**: 
- Multi-network contract deployment
- Network configuration in frontend

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- **Functional Requirements**:
  - Network selector in header showing current network
  - Clear visual distinction: Testnet (orange), Mainnet (green)
  - Network switch updates: contract addresses, RPC endpoints, indexer URLs
  - Wallet network validation and auto-switch prompt
  - Data isolation between networks (no testnet data on mainnet)
  - Network preference saved in localStorage
  - URL parameter support for network selection (?network=testnet)
  
- **Non-Functional Requirements**:
  - Network switch completed within 3 seconds
  - No data loss during network switch
  - Clear warning when switching to mainnet
  - Automatic reconnection after switch
  - Network status monitoring
  - Fallback RPC endpoints for reliability

**Unhappy Paths**:
  - Wallet on wrong network prompts switch
  - Network switch failure maintains current network
  - RPC unavailable shows maintenance message
  - Unsupported network shows error
