## Summary

This comprehensive breakdown reorganizes the project into three clear EPICs:

1. **Architecture EPIC**: 7 documentation and design stories for system architecture
2. **Cloud Infrastructure EPIC**: 10 actual infrastructure stories for platform deployment
3. **Implementation EPIC**: 15 detailed user stories with comprehensive subtasks

Key improvements in this reorganization:
- Moved functional requirements (wallet integration, trading interface, etc.) from Cloud Infrastructure to become subtasks within relevant user stories
- Created proper infrastructure stories for actual cloud/DevOps needs
- Each user story now includes detailed subtasks referencing the original technical stories as implementation details
- Maintained traceability while properly categorizing work

Total estimated effort: ~2,400 hours across all competencies and project areas.
